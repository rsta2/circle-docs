.. _TCP/IP networking:

TCP/IP networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the TCP/IP networking support in Circle. This covers initialization and configuration, the socket API, the available upper layer protocol clients and servers and a few utility classes. The TCP/IP networking support requires the scheduler in the system (see :ref:`Multitasking`).

The following sample programs demonstrate TCP/IP networking features:

==============	=========================================
Sample		Description
==============	=========================================
18-ntptime	Setting the system time from a NTP server
20-tcpsimple	TCP echo server
21-webserver	Simple HTTP webserver
31-webclient	Simple HTTP client (only for reference)
33-syslog	Send log messages to an UDP syslog server
35-mqttclient	MQTT client
38-bootloader	HTTP- and TFTP-based bootloader
==============	=========================================

.. note::

	Circle currently supports the IP multicast support level 1 (send only) according to RFC1112.

CNetSubSystem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cpp

	#include <circle/net/netsubsystem.h>

.. cpp:class:: CNetSubSystem

	This class represents the TCP/IP support in Circle. There can be only one instance of this class.

.. cpp:function:: CNetSubSystem::CNetSubSystem (const u8 *pIPAddress = 0, const u8 *pNetMask = 0, const u8 *pDefaultGateway = 0, const u8 *pDNSServer = 0, const char *pHostname = "raspberrypi", TNetDeviceType DeviceType = NetDeviceTypeEthernet)

	Creates the ``CNetSubSystem`` instance. The parameters ``pIPAddress``, ``pNetMask``, ``pDefaultGateway`` and ``pDNSServer`` point to 4-byte arrays, which define the network configuration (e.g. IP address {192, 168, 0, 42}). Set all these pointers to 0 to enable the dynamic network configuration using DHCP instead. ``pHostname`` specifies the host name, which is sent to the DHCP server (0 to disable). ``DeviceType`` can be ``NetDeviceTypeEthernet`` (default) or ``NetDeviceTypeWLAN``.

.. note::

	Setting ``DeviceType`` to ``NetDeviceTypeWLAN`` is not enough to access a WLAN. Instead you have to instantiate and initialize the classes ``CBcm4343Device`` (WLAN hardware driver), ``CNetSubSystem`` and ``CWPASupplicant`` (support task for secure WLAN access) in this order. Please see the subsection :ref:`WLAN support` and the `WLAN sample <https://github.com/rsta2/circle/tree/master/addon/wlan/sample/hello_wlan>`_  for details!

.. cpp:function:: boolean CNetSubSystem::Initialize (boolean bWaitForActivate = TRUE)

	Initializes the network subsystem. Usually this method returns after the network configuration has been assigned, if DHCP is enabled. This requires that the DHCP server can be reached and takes some time. If you want to speedup network initialization, you can set the parameter ``bWaitForActivate`` to ``FALSE``. Then this method will return immediately after initialization, but you have to test on your own, if the network is available using the method ``IsRunning()``, before accessing the network.

.. cpp:function:: boolean CNetSubSystem::IsRunning (void) const

	Returns ``TRUE``, when is TCP/IP network is available and configured. If DHCP is enabled, this means that an IP address is already bound.

.. cpp:function:: const char *CNetSubSystem::GetHostname (void) const

	Returns the hostname, which has been handed over to the constructor.

.. cpp:function:: CNetConfig *CNetSubSystem::GetConfig (void)

	Returns a pointer to the network configuration, which is saved in an instance of the class ``CNetConfig``. This is usually used to inform the user about the dynamically assigned configuration. You should not try to manipulate the configuration using this pointer.

.. cpp:function:: static CNetSubSystem *CNetSubSystem::Get (void)

	Returns a pointer to the instance of ``CNetSubSystem``.

CNetConfig
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cpp

	#include <circle/net/netconfig.h>

.. cpp:class:: CNetConfig

	An instance of this class holds the configuration of the TCP/IP networking subsystem. A pointer to this instance can be requested using ``CNetSubSystem::GetConfig()``. The following methods can be used to get the different configuration items.

.. cpp:function:: boolean CNetConfig::IsDHCPUsed (void) const

	Returns ``TRUE`` if the network is configured dynamically using DHCP.

.. cpp:function:: const CIPAddress *CNetConfig::GetIPAddress (void) const

	Returns our own IP address.

.. cpp:function:: const u8 *CNetConfig::GetNetMask (void) const

	Returns the net mask of the local network, we are connected to.

.. cpp:function:: const CIPAddress *CNetConfig::GetDefaultGateway (void) const

	Returns the IP address of the default gateway into the Internet.

.. cpp:function:: const CIPAddress *CNetConfig::GetDNSServer (void) const

	Returns the IP address of the Domain Name Service server.

.. cpp:function:: const CIPAddress *CNetConfig::GetBroadcastAddress (void) const

	Returns the (directed) broadcast address, which is valid in the local network, we are connected to.

CSocket
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cpp

	#include <circle/net/socket.h>
	#include <circle/net/in.h>		// for IPPROTO_*, MSG_DONTWAIT
	#include <circle/netdevice.h>		// for FRAME_BUFFER_SIZE

.. cpp:class:: CSocket : public CNetSocket

	This class forms the API for TCP/IP network access in Circle.

.. note::

	Port numbers at the Circle socket API are in host byte order. This means you do not need to swap the byte order to network order, when you specify a little endian number to an API function.

	Operations can be blocking or non-blocking. Blocking operations wait for the completion, before the function returns. Non-blocking operations return immediately, which means that you have to ensure on your own, that the system is not congested, e.g. if sending much data.

.. cpp:function:: CSocket::CSocket (CNetSubSystem *pNetSubSystem, int nProtocol)

	Creates a ``CSocket`` object, which represents one TCP/IP connection in Circle. ``pNetSubSystem`` is a pointer to the network subsystem. ``nProtocol`` can be ``IPPROTO_TCP``  or ``IPPROTO_UDP``.

.. cpp:function:: CSocket::~CSocket (void)

	Destroys a ``CSocket`` object and terminates an active connection.

.. cpp:function:: int CSocket::Bind (u16 usOwnPort)

	Binds the port number ``usOwnPort`` to this socket. Returns 0 on success or < 0 on error.

.. cpp:function:: int CSocket::Connect (const CIPAddress &rForeignIP, u16 usForeignPort)

	Connects to a foreign host/port (TCP) or setup a foreign host/port address (UDP). ``rForeignIP`` is the IP address of the host to be connected. ``usForeignPort`` is the number of the port to be connected. Returns 0 on success or < 0 on error.

.. cpp:function:: int CSocket::Listen (unsigned nBackLog = 4)

	Listens for incoming connections (TCP only). You must call ``Bind()`` before. ``nBackLog`` is the maximum number of simultaneous connections, which may be accepted in a row before ``Accept()`` is called (up to 32). Returns 0 on success or < 0 on error.

.. cpp:function:: CSocket *CSocket::Accept (CIPAddress *pForeignIP, u16 *pForeignPort)

	Accepts an incoming connection (TCP only). You must call ``Listen()`` before. ``pForeignIP`` points to a ``CIPAddress`` object, which receives the IP address of the remote host. The remote port number will be returned in ``*pForeignPort``. Returns a newly created socket to be used to communicate with the remote host, or 0 on error.

.. cpp:function:: int CSocket::Send (const void *pBuffer, unsigned nLength, int nFlags)

	Sends a message to a remote host. ``pBuffer`` is a pointer to the message and ``nLength`` is its length in bytes. ``nFlags`` can be ``MSG_DONTWAIT`` (non-blocking operation) or 0 (blocking operation). Returns the length of the sent message or < 0 on error.

.. cpp:function:: int CSocket::Receive (void *pBuffer, unsigned nLength, int nFlags)

	Receives a message from a remote host. ``pBuffer`` is a pointer to the message buffer and ``nLength`` is its size in bytes. ``nLength`` should be at least ``FRAME_BUFFER_SIZE``, otherwise data may get lost. ``nFlags`` can be ``MSG_DONTWAIT`` (non-blocking operation) or 0 (blocking operation). Returns the length of received message, which is 0 with ``MSG_DONTWAIT`` if no message is available, or < 0 on error.

.. cpp:function:: int CSocket::SendTo (const void *pBuffer, unsigned nLength, int nFlags, const CIPAddress &rForeignIP, u16 nForeignPort)

	Sends a message to a specific remote host. ``pBuffer`` is a pointer to the message and ``nLength`` is its length in bytes. ``nFlags`` can be ``MSG_DONTWAIT`` (non-blocking operation) or 0 (blocking operation). ``rForeignIP`` is the IP address of the host to be sent to (ignored on TCP socket). ``nForeignPort`` is the number of the port to be sent to (ignored on TCP socket). Returns the length of the sent message or < 0 on error.

.. cpp:function:: int CSocket::ReceiveFrom (void *pBuffer, unsigned nLength, int nFlags, CIPAddress *pForeignIP, u16 *pForeignPort)

	Receives a message from a remote host, returns host/port of remote host. ``pBuffer`` is a pointer to the message buffer and ``nLength`` is its size in bytes. ``nLength`` should be at least ``FRAME_BUFFER_SIZE``, otherwise data may get lost. ``nFlags`` can be ``MSG_DONTWAIT`` (non-blocking operation) or 0 (blocking operation). ``pForeignIP`` is a pointer to a ``CIPAddress`` object, which receives the IP address of the host, which has sent the message. The number of the port from which the message has been sent will be returned in ``*pForeignPort``. Returns the length of the received message, which is 0 with ``MSG_DONTWAIT`` if no message is available, or < 0 on error.

.. cpp:function:: int CSocket::SetOptionBroadcast (boolean bAllowed)

	``bAllowed`` specifies weather sending and receiving broadcast messages is allowed on this socket (default ``FALSE``). Call this with ``bAllowed = TRUE`` after ``Bind()`` or ``Connect()`` to be able to send and/or receive broadcast messages (ignored on TCP socket). Returns 0 on success or < 0 on error.

.. cpp:function:: const u8 *CSocket::GetForeignIP (void) const

	Returns a pointer to the IP address of the connected remote host (4 bytes) or 0, if the socket is not connected.

	This class implements a simple HTTP server as a task. You have to derive a user class from it, override the virtual methods and create it using the ``new`` operator to start it.

.. note::

	This class uses a listener/worker model. The initially created task listens for incoming requests (listener) and spawns a child task (worker), which processes the request and terminates afterwards.

.. cpp:function:: CHTTPDaemon::CHTTPDaemon (CNetSubSystem *pNetSubSystem, CSocket *pSocket = 0, unsigned nMaxContentSize = 0, u16 nPort = HTTP_PORT, unsigned nMaxMultipartSize = 0)

	Define this method to provide your own content. ``pPath`` is the path of the file to be sent (e.g. "/index.html", can be "/" too). ``pParams`` are the GET parameters ("" for none). ``pFormData`` contains the parameters from the form data from POST ("" for none). Copy your content to ``pBuffer``. ``*pLength`` is the buffer size in bytes on input and the content length on output. ``*ppContentType`` must be set to the MIME type, if it is not "text/html". This method has to return the HTTP status (``HTTPOK`` on success).

.. cpp:function:: virtual void CHTTPDaemon::WriteAccessLog (const CIPAddress &rRemoteIP, THTTPRequestMethod RequestMethod, const char *pRequestURI, THTTPStatus Status, unsigned nContentLength)

	Overwrite this method to implement your own access logging. ``rRemoteIP`` is the IP address of the client. ``RequestMethod`` is the method of the request and ``pRequestURI`` its URI. ``Status`` and ``nContentLength`` specify the returned HTTP status number and the length of the sent content. The default implementation of this method writes a message to the :ref:`System log`.

.. cpp:function:: boolean CHTTPDaemon::GetMultipartFormPart (const char **ppHeader, const u8 **ppData, unsigned *pLength)

	This method can be called from ``GetContent()`` and returns the next part of multipart form data (``TRUE`` if available). This data is not available after returning from ``GetContent()`` any more. ``*ppHeader`` returns a pointer to the part header. ``*ppData`` returns a pointer to part data. ``*pLength`` returns the part data length.

.. _WLAN support:

WLAN support
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The WLAN support in Circle is based on three elements:

1. Driver class :cpp:class:`CBcm4343Device` for the WLAN hardware
2. :ref:`TCP/IP networking` subsystem, which is instantiated with the class :cpp:class:`CNetSubSystem`
3. *WPA Supplicant* library, which is built from the submodule `hostap <https://github.com/rsta2/hostap/tree/hostap_0_7_0-circle>`_, and is instantiated via the wrapper class :cpp:class:`CWPASupplicant`

To enable WLAN support in Circle, these elements have to be created and initialized in this order. This is demonstrated in the `WLAN sample <https://github.com/rsta2/circle/tree/master/addon/wlan/sample/hello_wlan>`_. The third element is only required to use secure WLAN networks.

.. note::

	The TCP/IP networking subsystem must be configured to use the WLAN device (``NetDeviceTypeWLAN``) and must be initialized, without waiting for an IP address from the DHCP server (with the parameter ``FALSE``). Because the DHCP protocol requires *WPA Supplicant* to work, :cpp:func:`CNetSubSystem::Initialize()` would never return otherwise.

CWPASupplicant
""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: cpp

	#include <wlan/hostap/wpa_supplicant/wpasupplicant.h>

.. cpp:class:: CWPASupplicant

	This class is a wrapper for the well-known *WPA Supplicant* application, which has been ported to Circle as a library. An instance of this class is required for connecting to secure (i.e. WPA2) WLAN networks. The WLAN hardware driver :cpp:class:`CBcm4343Device` and the :ref:`TCP/IP networking` subsystem must already running, when *WPA Supplicant* is initialized.

.. cpp:function:: CWPASupplicant::CWPASupplicant (const char *pConfigFile)

	Creates an instance of this class. ``pConfigFile`` is the path to the configuration file (e.g. "SD:/wpa_supplicant.conf").

.. cpp:function:: boolean CWPASupplicant::Initialize (void)

	Initializes the *WPA Supplicant* module and automatically starts to connect to one of the WLAN networks, which have been configured in the configuration file.

.. cpp:function:: boolean CWPASupplicant::IsConnected (void) const

	Returns ``TRUE``, if a connection to a configured WLAN network is currently active.
